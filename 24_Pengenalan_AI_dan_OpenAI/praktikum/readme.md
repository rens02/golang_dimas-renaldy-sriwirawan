- Input

```
def foo(n, k):
    accum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for l in range(k):
            accum += i
    return accum
```

- Output

The time complexity of this code is O(n * k), where n is the value of the variable `n` and k is the value of the variable `k`. This is because there are two nested loops, one iterating `n` times and the other iterating `k` times. The `accum += i` operation is executed `n * k` times, resulting in a time complexity of O(n * k).
